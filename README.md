E-Leaves
========

A web application that helps companies manage their employees leave applications.

*IMPORTANT*

I have written this application a very long time ago. 5 years to be exact.

Back then, my web programming knowledge was almost 0. I knew only C from college and Matlab! So, it was a first attempt. It was not easy and of course, it's not perfect.

I had no knowledge about any PHP frameworks back then, no CSS frameworks, nothing. So, everything was done in a very conventional and procedural style of programming. Many a times, you might find this code long, and un-necessarily complex.

Anyhow, I am releasing it to the public, take it, improve on it, do whatever you want with it. It's pretty easy to use. I just hope you won't take it and sell it as your own!

Final note before I go into installation instructions:

There are quiet few warnings, I don't think they will affect the code functionality. Also, it was written using old deprecated functions like mysql_query and its likes. Last but not least, It uses the old PHP mail function. So, use at your own risk!

==================

*Installation*

Pretty easy, just unzip the files to your root directory or wherever you want the files to be, create a new database (name it app1) and import the sql file contained in the package.

Login for admin is: admin/admin

==================

*How to use the system*

Note: To test the features as they should be in a real company situation, Register as a new user, then login using the admin account, activate the user and set his leaves credits. You can then login as the user and test the user functionalities, make new leave applications and then you can use the admin account to approve or reject applications.
